# About

The UBC/SFU Joint Statistics Seminar is jointly hosted by the graduate students of the [UBC Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/) and the [SFU Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://www.sfu.ca/stat-actsci.html). The Spring 2022 event is the second of two events taking place in the 2021/2022 academic year. The Fall 2021 event was organized by graduate students from SFU, and the Spring 2022 event is organized by graduate students from UBC. Over its 17-year history, the event has offered Statistics and Actuarial Science graduate and undergraduate students at both schools an opportunity to network with their peers and to attend accessible talks about the research work of their fellow students and faculty. 

The Spring 2022 event includes talks given by six students (three from UBC and three from SFU) and one faculty member from UBC.

<p><strong>Optimal Roster Construction In Sports</strong></p>
<p>In Major League Sports (MLB, NBA, NHL, NFL), it is the Front Office Staff (FOS) who make decisions about who plays for their respective team. The FOS bear the brunt of the responsibility for acquiring players through drafting, trading and signing players in free agency while typically contesting with maximum roster salary constraints. The players themselves are volatile assets of these teams- their value fluctuates with age and performance. A simple comparison can be made when viewing players as assets. The problem here is similar to that of optimizing your investment portfolio. The goal is ultimately to maximize your periodic returns while tolerating a fixed risk (degree of uncertainty/ potential loss). Each franchise may value assets differently, and some may only tolerate lower risk levels- these are examples of factors that introduce additional constraints into the model. In this talk we will detail the mathematical formulation of this problem as a constrained optimization problem- which can be solved with classical machine learning methods, but is also well posed as a problem to be solved on quantum computers.</p>
